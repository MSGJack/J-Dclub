                        <p>Sequel to the first game, Jak II was a major success with a much darker tone than it's predecessor and open world ambitious gameplay. It's also notorious for being one of the most difficult games of it's era.</p>

                        <p>The conclusion of the Jak trilogy, Jak 3 ended the series on a high note. Buliding upon the gameplay from Jak 2, without the hard difficulty, Jak 3 received universal praise on all aspects. </p>

                            <p>A very different entry in the Jak series, Jak X was focused on racing instead of the adventure gameplay from the previous 3 games. Even with it being more different, Jak X still found success with it's surprisingly variety of different modes and being a solid game.</p>

                            <p>The last game of the Jak series, The Lost Frontier took our heroes to the air. With it's new aerial gameplay, The Lost Frontier was still a success even if it wasn't as beloved as the pervious games. This marked the last time we saw our heroes in their own Adenture. They have made appearances in other games tho. </p>
